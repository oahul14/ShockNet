# Project Plan Guideline

## background / introduction
1. How is it going with the traditional solutions?
2. What methods have been done for numerical solutions? 
	* Discussion including literatures about FDM, FEM, MFS and DEM etc. What are their relative advantages/disadvantages
3. Why considering machine learning approach?
	* Less time consuming, requiring some figures to prove
	* Principally available due to the non-linear behavior of wave propagation
4. Previous work done on machine learning
	* RNN, LSTM
	* CNN: VGG, ResNet
	* FC layers: U-Net
	* Combined work of CNN and RNN(LSTM)
	* GAN: multiscale generator
	* Discuss their differences/advantages/comparisons/target problems

## Project Plan

1. Preparation tasks: 2.5 weeks (by 20/06)
	* Get used to Ansys, an industrial simulation tool: by 14/06
	* Try to automate the simulation process: by 14/06
	* Ongoing with the first two, do more research on previous literatures: by 20/06 â€“ along with writing with the plan
2. Simulating: 2 weeks (by 08/07)
	* Simulate with different loads: by 27/06
	* Simulate with different overall domain shapes: by 02/07
	* Simulate with different combination of media: by 08/07
	* Loading the data: less than a week (by 08/07)
3. Machine learning: combined work finishing by 17/08
	* Model selection and testing with relatively small data size: by 
	* Train data with previous simulation results
	* Also need to generate simulation results along with training the scheme
4. Report writing: 	* 2 weeks (by the deadline 28/08)
